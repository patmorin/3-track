\section{Introduction}
\pagenumbering{arabic}

A \emph{$t$-track assignment} of a graph $G$ is a partition of $V(G)$
into $t$ independent sets $T_1,\ldots,T_t$ along with $t$ relations
$\prec_1,\ldots,\prec_t$, where $\prec_i$ defines a total order on $T_i$
for each $i\in\{1,\ldots,t\}$. An \emph{X-crossing} in a track layout is a
pair of edges $vw$ and $xy$ such that, for some $i,j\in\{1,\ldots,t\}$,
$v,x\in T_i$ with $v\prec_i x$ and $w,y\in T_j$ with $y\prec_j w$.
A $t$-track assignment is called a \emph{$t$-track layout} if it has no
X-crossing.  The minimum number of tracks in any $t$-track layout of $G$
is called the track number of $G$ and is denoted as $\tr(G)$.

A \emph{path decomposition} of $G$ is a sequence of sets
$B_1,\ldots,B_p\subseteq V(G)$ called \emph{bags} such that
\begin{enumerate}
   \item For each $v\in V(G)$, the bags that contain $v$ form a contiguous subsequence.
   \item For each edge $vw\in E(G)$, there is some bag that contains both $v$ and $w$.
\end{enumerate}
The \emph{width} of a path decomposition is the size of its largest bag.  The \emph{pathwidth} of $G$, denoted $\pw(G)$, is the minimum width of any path decomposition of $G$.

A \emph{layering} of $G$ is a mapping $\ell:V(G)\to\Z$ with the
property that $vw\in E(G)$ implies $|\ell(u)-\ell(w)|\le 1$. One
can also think of a layering as a partition of $G$'s vertices into
sets indexed by integers, where the \emph{layer} $L_i=\{v\in V(G)
: \ell(v)=i\}$.  A \emph{layered path decomposition} of $G$ consists
of a layering $\ell$ and a path decomposition $B_1,\ldots,B_p$ of $G$.
The \emph{(layered) width} of a layered path decomposition is the maximum
size of the intersection of a bag and a layer, i.e., $\max\{|L_i\cap
B_j|:i\in\Z,\, j\in\{1,\ldots,p\}\}$.  The \emph{layered pathwidth} of
$G$, denoted $\lpw(G)$ is the smallest (layered) width of any layered
path decomposition of $G$.

In this paper, we prove the following result, resolving an open question
posed by Bannister \etal\ \cite{bannister.devanny.ea:track}:

\begin{thm}\thmlabel{main}
  If $\tr(G)\le 3$, then $\lpw(G)\le 8$.
\end{thm}

\section{Proof of \thmref{main}}

It will be slightly easier to prove our result for a weaker notion
of layering.  An \emph{$s$-weak layering} of $G$ is a mapping
$\ell:V(G)\to\Z$ with the property that, for every $vw\in E(G)$,
$|\ell(v)-\ell(w)|\le s$.  The sets $L_i=\{v\in V(G): \ell(v)=i\}$
are called $s$-weak layers.  The terms \emph{$s$-weak layered path
decomposition} and \emph{$s$-weak layered pathwidth} of $G$, denoted
$\lpw_s(G)$, are defined the same way as layered path decompositions
and layered pathwidth, but with respect to $s$-weak layerings of $G$.

\begin{lem}\lemlabel{weak}
  For any $s\in\N$, $\lpw(G) \le s\cdot\lpw_s(G)$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
  Given an $s$-weak layered decomposition of $G$ with $s$-weak layering
  $\ell$, we define $\ell'(v)=\lfloor\ell(v)/s\rfloor$. Now $\ell'$
  is clearly a layering of $G$ and, by definition, for any bag $B_j$
  and any $s$-weak layer $L_i=\{v\in V(G):\ell(v)=i\}$, $|L_i\cap B_j|\le
  \lpw_s(G)$.  Therefore, since any layer $L_i'=\{v\in V(G):\ell'(v)=i\}$
  is the union of $s$ weak layers, $|L_i'\cap B_j|\le s\cdot\lpw_s(G)$
  for all $i\in Z$.
\end{proof}

Let $G$ be an edge maximal $n$-vertex graph with $\tr(G)=3$.  It is
helpful to recall that $G$ is a planar graph that has a straight-line
plane drawing with the vertices of $T_1$ placed on the positive x-axis,
the vertices of $T_2$ placed on the positive y-axis and the vertices of
$T_3$ placed on the ray $\{(a,a):a<0\}$. See \figref{planar-view}. (The
edges in \figref{planar-view} are drawn as curves only to help
readability, . The drawing would be non-crossing even if all edges were
drawn as straight lines.)

\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
     \includegraphics{figs/path-1}
  \end{center}
  \caption{The standard planar embedding of a 3-track graph.}
  \figlabel{planar-view}
\end{figure}

Let $T_1,\ldots,T_3$ be a 3-track layout of $G$ with
$T_1=\{x_1,\ldots,x_{n_1}\}$, $T_2=\{y_1,\ldots,y_{n_2}\}$, and
$T_3=\{z_1,\ldots,z_{n_3}\}$ and the total orders $\prec_1,\ldots,\prec_3$
are implicit so that, for example $z_i\prec_3 z_j$ if and only if $i<j$.
In terms of \figref{planar-view}, this means that $x_1,y_1,z_1$ form
the triangular face containing the origin and $x_{n_1},y_{n_2},z_{n_3}$
form the cycle on the boundary of the outer face.
From this point onward, all track indices are implicitly taken ``modulo 3''
so that for any integer $i$, $T_i$ refers to the track $T_{i'}$ with
index $i'=((i-1)\bmod 3)+1$.  

The following observation follows from the fact that $G$ is edge maximal.
\begin{obs}\obslabel{silly}
  For any two vertices of $G$ on distinct tracks, say $x_i$ and $y_j$, at least
  one of the following conditions is satisified (see \figref{3-cases}):
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $x_iy_j\in E(G)$; or
    \item there exists $x_{i'}y_{j'} \in E(G)$ with $i'>i$ and $j'<j$; or
    \item there exists $x_iy_j'\in E(G)$ with $j'>j$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{obs}

     \end{tabular}
   \end{center}
   \caption{The three cases in \obsref{silly}.}
   \figlabel{3-cases}
\end{figure}

\thmref{main} is a consequence of the
following lemma.

\begin{lem}\lemlabel{main}
  The graph $G$ described above has a 4-weak layered path decomposition
  $\ell$, $B_1,\ldots,B_p$ of (layered) width $2$ in which 
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item for each $i\in\{1,\ldots,3\}$ and each $v\in T_i$,
      $\ell(v)\equiv i\pmod 3$;
    \item $B_1=\{x_1,y_1,z_1\}$;
    \item $\ell(x_1)=1$, $\ell(y_1)=2$, and $\ell(z_1)=3$;
    \item $B_p=\{x_{n_1},y_{n_2},z_{n_3}\}$; and
    \item $x_{n_1},y_{n_2},z_{n_3}$ appear in 3 consecutive layers.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{lem}

Before proving \lemref{main}, we show how it implies \thmref{main}.
Since layered pathwidth is monotone with respect to the addition of edges,
it is safe to assume (as \lemref{main} does) that $G$ is edge maximal.
By \lemref{main}, therefore $G$ has $\lpw_4(G)=2$ and therefore, by
\lemref{weak}, $\lpw(G)\le 8$.

\begin{proof}[Proof of \lemref{main}]
  The proof is by induction on the number of vertices of $G$.  If
  $|V(G)|\le 4$, then the result is trivial.  Next, Suppose that $G$ has
  a cut set $C=\{x_i,y_j,z_k\}$ having exactly one vertex in each track.
  Since $G$ is edge maximal, $x_i,y_j,z_k$ form a cycle in $G$.  Now,
  the subgraph $G_1$ of $G$ induced by $\{x_1,\ldots,x_i, y_1,\ldots,y_j,
  z_1,\ldots,z_k\}$ is an edge maximal graph with $\tr(G_1)=3$ and we
  can inductively apply \lemref{main} to find a width-2 4-weak layered
  path decomposition of $G_1$ in which $x_i,y_j,z_k$ are in the last bag
  and are assigned to three consecutive layers $r+1$, $r+2$, and $r+3$.
  Note that there are three possible assignments of $x_i,y_j,z_k$ to
  these three layers depending on the value of $r\bmod 3$.  Suppose,
  without loss of generality, that $\ell(y_j)=r+1$ (so $\ell(z_k)=r+2$
  and $\ell(x_i)=r+3$.)

  Next, consider the graph $G_2$ induced by
  $\{x_i,\ldots,x_{n_1},y_j,\ldots,y_{n_2},z_k,\ldots,z_{n_3}\}$.
  We apply \lemref{main} inductively on $G_2$ relabelling tracks to
  ensure that in the resulting layered decomposition $\ell(y_j)=1$,
  $\ell(z_k)=2$ and $\ell(x_i)=3$.   We can now obtain a width-2 4-weak
  layered path decomposition of $G$ by joining the two decompositions.
  In particular,  concatenating the sequence of bags for $G_1$ with
  the sequence of bags for $G_2$ gives a path decomposition of $G$
  and addding $r$ to the indices of all layers in the layering of $G_2$
  gives a 4-weak layering of $G$.

  Thus, all that remains is to study the case where $G$ contains no cut
  set having exactly one vertex on each track.  We claim that, in this
  case, $G$ contains the edge $x_1z_2$ or it contains the edge $z_1x_2$.
  Since $G$ is edge-maximal, this is obvious unless $n_1=n_3=1$ so
  that neither $z_2$ nor $x_2$ exist.  However, since $|V(G)|\ge 5$,
  this would imply that $x_1,z_1,y_2$ is a cut set with one vertex on
  each track, since its removal separates $y_1$ from $y_3$.

  Assume, without loss of generality, that $G$ contains the edge $z_1x_2$.
  We will construct a path $P=v_1,\ldots,v_r$, an example of which is illustrated in \figref{path}.
  The first four vertices of $P$ are 
  $x_1,y_1,z_1,x_2$ and the final three vertices are $x_{n_1}$,
  $y_{n_2}$, and $z_{n_3}$, though not necessarily in that order.
  The path $P$ will \emph{spiral} in the sense that $v_i\in T_i$
  for all $i\in\{1,\ldots,r\}$.  Observe that, since $P$ begins with
  $x_1,y_1,z_1,x_2$, this spiralling implies that the subsequence of $P$ on any
  track $T_i$ is increasing (getting further from the origin).

  
  \begin{figure}
     \begin{center}
        \includegraphics{figs/path-2}
     \end{center}
     \caption{The path $P$ used in the proof of \lemref{main}.}
     \figlabel{path}
  \end{figure}

  After the initial four vertices, $P$ is constructed greedily: if $P$
  has reached vertex $v_k$, it continues to any neighbour $v_{k+1}$
  of $v_k$ on track $T_{k+1}$ that is not yet in $P$.  
  To see why this is always possible,
  recall that $P$ already contains an edge $v_{k-3},v_{k-2}$. Now,
  apply \obsref{silly} with $x_i=v_k$ and $y_j=v_{k-2}$, so there
  are three cases (see \figref{sloppy}):

\begin{figure}
   \begin{center}
     \begin{tabular}{ccc}
       \includegraphics{figs/sloppy-1} &
       \includegraphics{figs/sloppy-2} &
       \includegraphics{figs/sloppy-3} \\
       (1) & (2) & (3) 
     \end{tabular}
   \end{center}
   \caption{The path $P$ can always be extended.}
   \figlabel{sloppy}
\end{figure}


  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $v_k v_{k-2}\in E(G)$.  In this
  case $v_{k-2}$, $v_{k-1}$, and $v_k$ form a cycle in $G$.  Then either
  $\{v_{k-2},v_{k-1},v_{k}\}=\{x_{n_1},y_{n_2},z_{n_3}\}$ or
  $\{v_{k-2},v_{k-1},v_{k}\}$ is a cut set with exactly one vertex in
  each track.  In the former case, the path $P$ is complete. The latter case is   excluded by the assumption that $G$ contains no such cut sets.

  \item there exists an edge $x_{i'}y_{j'}\in E(G)$ with $i' > i$ and $j'< j$.  This case is not possible, since this edge would cross $v_{k-3}v_{k-2}$.

  \item there exists an edge $v_k y_{j'}\in E(G)$ with $j' >j$.  In this case, $P$ is extended by adding $v_{k+1}=y_{j'}$.
  \end{enumerate}
%  To see that this process does indeed produce the desired path, we
%  first claim that, for each $t\in \{1,\ldots,3\}$, the subsequence of
%  $P$ induced by $T_t$ is increasing. This can be proven by induction
%  the number of vertices added to $P$. Refer to \figref{combo}(a).
%  If $v_a=x_i$, then $v_{a-3}=x_{i'}$ with (by induction) $i'< i$.
%  Now, $P$ contains an edge $v_{a-3}v_{a-2}=x_{i'}y_{j'}$ for some $j'$.
%  The existence of this edge in $G$ ensures that the next vertex $v_{a+1}$
%  (if any) added to $P$ is $y_j$ for some $j > j'$.  (Using a vertex
%  $y_j$ with $j < j'$ would imply that $x_{i'}y_{j'}$ and $x_iy_j$
%  form an X-crossing.)
%

%    \end{center}
%    \caption{Two steps in the proof of \lemref{main}: (a)~the sequence $P\cap T_2$ is monotone and (b)~the $v_{r-2},v_{r-1},v_r$ is a cycle.}
%    \figlabel{combo}
%  \end{figure}
%
%
%  Next, we claim that
%  $\{v_{r-2},v_{r-1},v_{r}\}=\{x_{n_1},y_{n_2},z_{n_2}\}$. To see this,
%  suppose without loss of generality, that $v_r\in T_1$, so $v_r=x_i$
%  for some $i\in\{1,\ldots,n_1\}$. Refer to \figref{combo}(b). The only
%  reason $P$ ends at $x_i$ is that $x_i$ has no neighbour in $T_{2}$
%  that is not already in $P$.  Since $G$ is edge maximal, this already
%  implies that $v_{r-2}=y_{n_2}$, otherwise $v_r$ would have a neighbor
%  in $T_2$ that is not already in $P$.  Again, since $G$ is edge maximal,
%  this implies $v_r$ is adjacent to $v_{r-2}$.
%
%  Thus far, we have established that $v_{r-2},v_{r-1},v_{r}$ forms a
%  cycle $C$ and, in the planar embedding of $G$, $C$ separates $v_{r-3}$
%  (which is inside of $C$) from any vertices outside of $C$.  If there are
%  any vertices outside of $C$, this would make $C$ a cut set consisting
%  of one vertex from each track, which we have already ruled out.
%  Therefore, there are no vertices outside of $C$ and 
%  $C=x_{n_1},y_{n_2},z_{n_2}$, as claimed.

  Thus we have constructed a path $P=v_1,\ldots,v_r$ whose first three
  vertices are $x_1,y_1,z_1$ and whose last three vertices are $x_{n_1}$,
  $y_{n_2}$ and $z_{n_3}$ (not necessarily in order).  We assign layers
  to the vertices of $P$ as follows: For each vertex $v_i$ on $P$,
  we set $\ell(v_i)=i$.  Note that this satisfies Conditions~3 and 5
  of the lemma and also satisfies Condition~1 for the vertices of $P$.
  For each $t\in\{1,\ldots,3\}$, any vertex $v\in T_t$ that is not in
  $P$ is assigned to the same layer as $v$'s immediate predecessor in
  $P\cap T_t$.  This assignment satisifies Condition~1 for vertices not
  in $P$.  Finally, observe that this gives a 4-weak layering of $G$ (in
  the worst case, a vertex $v$ with $\ell(v)=i$ is adjacent to $v_{i+4}$).

  Now, consider the graph $G-P$ obtained by removing the vertices of $P$
  from $G$ (see \figref{g-p}).  We claim that this graph is a levelled
  planar graph \cite{bannister.devanny.ea:track} in which the levels
  of the vertices are given by the layering $\ell$ defined above.
  Refer to \figref{prism}.  One way to see this is to imagine $G$
  as being drawn with its vertices on the three vertical edges of
  a hollow triangular prism so that $x_1,y_1,z_1$ are the vertices of one
  triangular face and $x_{n_1},y_{n_2},z_{n_3}$ are the vertices of
  the other triangular face.  Now, if we remove the triangular faces
  of this prism, cut it along the embedding of $P$, and unfold
  the resulting surface so that it lies in the plane, then we obtain a
  drawing of $G-P$ in which the vertices lie on a set of parallel lines
  and in which the edges only join vertices on two consecutive lines.
  This gives the desired levelled planar drawing of $G-P$.

  \begin{figure}

  \end{figure}


  \begin{figure}
     \begin{center}
        \includegraphics{figs/prism}
     \end{center}
     \caption{Cutting a prism along $P$ to obtain a levelled planar
      drawing of $G-P$.
      In the unfolding, edges of $G-P$ are drawn in black. Edges that
      span 4 layers are drawn in orange.}
     \figlabel{prism}
  \end{figure}

  By a result of Bannister \etal\ \cite[Proof of
  Theorem~5]{bannister.devanny.ea:track}, $G-P$ has a layered
  path decomposition $B_1,\ldots,B_p$ of width 1 using the layering 
  $\ell$ defined above.  If we add the vertices of $P$ to every bag
  of this decomposition we obtain a width-2 4-weak layered path
  decomposition of $G$.  Finally, to satisfy Conditions 2 and 4 of
  the lemma, we prepend a bag $B_0=\{x_1,y_1,z_1\}$ and append a bag
  $B_{p+1}=\{x_{n_1},y_{n_2},z_{n_3}\}$.
\end{proof}

We note that it is possible to unravel the induction in the proof of
\lemref{main}.  In particular, even if $G$ has cut sets with exactly
one vertex on each track, we can still construct the path $P$ starting
from $x_1,y_1,z_1$ until it is not possible to extend $P$. This happens
either because $P$ includes $x_{n_1},y_{n_2},z_{n_3}$ or because $P$
includes some cut set $x_i$, $y_j$, $z_k$.  In the latter case, we
continue extending $P$ by spiralling in the other direction.  Again,
cutting the prism along $P$ produces a layering of $G$ that is compatible
with a levelled planar drawing of $G-P$.  The fact that this layering is
also a 4-weak layering of $G$ follows from the fact that $P$ only changes
directions after crossing a cut set.


\section{Remarks}

An obvious question is how far \thmref{main} can be generalized. As
Bannister \etal\ \cite{bannister.devanny.ea:track} point out, it can
not be generalized to graphs with track number 4; there exists graphs
with track number 4 that have unbounded layered pathwidth.

Another generalization, that arises naturally from the standard planar
drawing of 3-track graphs is the following. Refer to \figref{web}.
A \emph{$k$-web} is a graph that has a straight line drawing with its
vertices placed on $k$ concentric rays and such that every edge joins a
pair of vertices on two consecutive rays.  The set of 3-webs is exactly
the set of graphs with track-number at most 3.  Our proof of \lemref{main}
generalizes in a straightforward manner to the following result:

\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics{figs/web}
  \end{center}
  \caption{An edge-maximal 7-web.}
  \figlabel{web}
\end{figure}

\begin{thm}
   Every $k$-web $G$ has layered pathwidth at most $2(k+1)$.
\end{thm}

Is this dependence on $k$ asymptotically optimal, or even necessary?

In our proof of \lemref{main} we use the trick of cutting a prism along
a path $P$ in order to obtain a levelled planar drawing of $G-P$.
Bannister \etal\ \cite{bannister.devanny.ea:track} use what, on the
surface, appears to be a somewhat different method to obtain a levelled
planar drawing of a bipartite 3-track graph.  In particular, they use
an argument based on winding numbers.  These two techniques, however,
are not so different. Their winding-number argument shows (though not
explicitly) that the standard drawing of a bipartite 3-track graph
does not contain any cycle that contains the origin.  Thus, there is
a path $P$ from the origin to infinity that avoids vertices and edges
of the graph.  In the drawing of this graph on the triangular prism,
the path $P$ becomes a path from one triangular face of the prism to the
other triangular face that avoids all edges and vertices of the graph.
Cutting along this path and unfolding gives a levelled planar drawing.
